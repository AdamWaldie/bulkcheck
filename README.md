Powershell script with a Winforms GUI for mass-checking IP addresses against the AbuseIPDB database. Input a CSV list of IP addresses (one per line) and return a CSV-formatted report with abuse report information, country code, ISP and domain of each IP checked. You will need an API key from the AbuseIP Database, available for free at: (https://www.abuseipdb.com/account/api). Can be run as a script or through the pre-packaged EXE.
