Powershell script with a Winforms GUI for mass-checking IP addresses against the AbuseIPDB database. Input a CSV list of IP addresses (one per line) and return a CSV-formatted report with abuse report information, country code, isp and domain of each IP checked. You will need an API key from the AbuseIP Database, available for free at: https://www.abuseipdb.com/account/api.
